FORESTBOOK: NOTEBOOK FOR THE JUNGLE TRAVELER
In this project, we are going to write an application that allows a user to keep track of the observations he makes in the forest in a notebook.
Most functionality from this ForestBook project:
- Add plants
- Add animals
- Sorting plants and animals
- filter animals in a list [Carnivore, Herbivore, Omnivore]
- print animals and plants
